# Welcome to FlipEngine
A hobby 3D-engine with main focus on Direct3D (11) for now. Here I will learn new techniques and programming in general with main focus in 3D-rendering.

# Tested platform
* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2022

# How to download
You can download it using git with the command:

> git clone https://github.com/FilipWickstrom/FlipEngine.git --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules.

This will download all the 3rd-party libraries that are needed to build the project. 

# Build project
Go into the folder called "ProjectBuild" and build the solution using one of the files depending on what version of Visual Studio you are using.

# Libraries and 3rd-parties
* [GLFW (3.3)](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/)
